# VBA-Pivot-Table-Filtering
A VBA program which creates several filtered pivot tables from a large data pull. Used to create pivot tables of weekly withheld tax amounts from a large data pull. Storing in GitHub as it has a VBA loop that is very helpful anytime I want to have VBA filter a pivot table.
